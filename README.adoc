= Analysis notebook

== Description

This notebook is based on continuumio/miniconda, with the following
modifications:

- You are expected to mount a volume with project source code at /code
- entrypoint.sh creates `someuser` and gives it the uid of the /code directory
  unless it is owned by root.
- You can enter a running container as `someuser` by running:
  ```[language=bash]
  docker exec -it <containername> login
  ```


== Typical usage:

```[language=bash]
docker run -v $(pwd):/code -p 8888:888 -d <myapp>
```
