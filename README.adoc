= Analysis notebook

== Description

This notebook is based on continuumio/miniconda, with the following
modifications:

- You are expected to mount a volume with project source code at /code
- entrypoint.sh creates `someuser` and gives it the uid of the /code directory
  unless it is owned by root.
- You can enter a running container as `someuser` by running:

```[language=bash]
docker exec -it --rm <containername> login
```


== Example usage for standalone app:

```[language=bash]
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code -p 8888:8888 <myapp> 
```


== Example usage for notebook:
```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code -p 8888:8888 jupyter notebook --port=8888 --ip=0.0.0.0
```
